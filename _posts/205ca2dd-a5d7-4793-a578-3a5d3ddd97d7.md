Itâ€™s hard to believe that YRHacks 2025 has come to a close â€” and with it, my second year as Chair of Canadaâ€™s largest high school hackathon.

Over the past three years, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of watching YRHacks grow from a dream into something far greater than I ever imagined. If thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™ve truly learned from this journey, itâ€™s that what happens *behind the scenes* is just as important as what the world sees on event day.

### What do I remember most?

Funny enough, when I look back, the moments that stick with me arenâ€™t the big milestones. Itâ€™s the tiny, unexpected ones: late-night brainstorms, messages that turn into inside jokes, and cooking up 400 cups of bubble tea while running on adrenaline and 5 hours of sleep. These are the memories Iâ€™ll treasure most.

Iâ€™m incredibly grateful to everyone whoâ€™s supported me and helped me grow into this role. While Iâ€™ve led the team, Iâ€™ve always believed that the best leadership is quiet and hands-on â€” more action, less spotlight. Most of the time, I was just another helping hand. Instead of seeing it as "task delegation" I feel like I was able to foster an environment where everyone wanted to help wherever they could.

To our 2025 team â€” thank you. For showing up to weekly meetings, for grinding out last-minute logistics, for solving tech issues mid-hack, and for always keeping the vibes high. You were the heart of this event, and Iâ€™m so lucky to have worked alongside each of you.

This year, we welcomed **250 participants** from **20 schools**, guided by our dedicated supervisors. Even more exciting? **60% of our hackers were first-timers**. Thatâ€™s something Iâ€™m especially proud of â€” because what makes YRHacks so special isnâ€™t just the projects (though they were amazing). Itâ€™s the *energy*.

It feels like a close-knit school club, yet it brings together students from across the region. It offers the support, resources, and mentorship that most clubs could only dream of. Thereâ€™s just something magical about teams forming on the spot, solving real problems, pivoting at 3 a.m., and celebrating all those tiny wins that build up to something unforgettable.

### Whatâ€™s Next?
While I wonâ€™t be organizing another YRHacks, this chapter isnâ€™t really closingâ€”itâ€™s just evolving. I know the next generation of organizers will bring fresh ideas, new energy, and even more ambitious dreams. I canâ€™t wait to watch it grow from afar, knowing I played a small part in building something meaningful.

If youâ€™re thinking about starting your own event, team, or initiativeâ€”*do it*. And do it with heart. The late nights are worth it. The stress melts away when you see someone smile because of something you helped create.

YRHacks was never just a hackathon. It was a community, a proving ground, a playground, and a launchpad. It taught me about logistics, leadership, empathy, and letting go of perfection in favor of progress.

Soâ€¦ yes, itâ€™s the end of an era.

But itâ€™s also the start of whatever comes next!!!

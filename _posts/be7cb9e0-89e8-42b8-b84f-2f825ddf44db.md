This weekend, I had the opportunity to participate in my **third in-person hackathon**, **JAMHacks 8**, at the **University of Waterloo**. I'm super grateful to say that my team (Chelsea Wong, Soheil Rajabali, and Parsa Ahmadnezhad) and I were awarded:

🥈 **2nd Place** 🥈  
🏆 **Most Creative Adobe Express Add-On [MLH]** 🏆

### Throwback to JAMHacks 7

Funny enough, JAMHacks 7 was my **first in-person hackathon** (where my team bagged the **Best Game Hack**), so I was thrilled to be back and see everyone again. Like always, the hackathon was a blast—**amazing organizers, judges, mentors,** and most importantly, **hackers**.

### Our Project: Signematic

We developed a project named **"Signematic,"** designed to offer **live sign language transcription** for entertainment and content creators. Leveraging **advanced algorithms** and **gesture models**, our solution aims to enhance the viewing experience for the **deaf and hard-of-hearing community** by providing accurate and real-time sign language interpretation.

> Anyone who knows our team knows that this project was completely out of our comfort zones. I'm so glad we stuck to it throughout the entire hackathon!

### Prizes and Recognition

In addition to the incredible experience, we were also fortunate to receive some amazing prizes. Each member of our team was awarded:

- A **Wacom tablet**
- A **wireless speaker**
- **Wireless earbuds**
- A cozy **full-zip sweater** from DoraHacks

These tangible reminders of our achievements will certainly fuel our passion for innovation and problem-solving in future hackathons.

### Let's Connect!

To all the wonderful people I met this weekend, **don't hesitate to reach out!** I'm down to meet up anytime. 😊

Lastly, a big thank you to **Major League Hacking** and **JAMHacks** for an unforgettable weekend and the fantastic photos!

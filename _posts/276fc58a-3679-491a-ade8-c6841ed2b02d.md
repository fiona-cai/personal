This past year, stepping into the role of Chair for YRHacks was an adventure like no other. YRHacks isn’t just another hackathon; it’s Canada’s largest high school hackathon and the official one for the York Region District School Board (YRDSB). Organizing YRHacks 2024 was a whirlwind of planning, late nights, and some good old-fashioned teamwork to create a place for students to innovate, connect, and be inspired.

### Taking on a New Team
When I started as Chair in grade 11, I took over from our senior leaders with a newly formed executive team. I didn’t choose this team; they’d been selected by those who led before us. But we quickly realized we shared the same passion for tech and excitement about YRHacks. From the get-go, our goal was clear: bring YRHacks back to life as an in-person event, something we’d all missed. With each executive bringing their own strengths and fresh ideas, my focus became clear: unite these talents, keep us aligned, and make sure everything went as smoothly as possible.

Bringing the hackathon back in person was no small feat after years of virtual events. We were incredibly lucky to book the Dr. Bette Stephenson Centre for Learning as our venue. Working with principals, the SHSM program, and supportive teachers, we were able to pull it off, with over 300 students signing up and filling the space with excitement and energy that could only come from an in-person event.

### The Challenge of Timing
One of our biggest challenges? Timing. We had to hold YRHacks on a weekday to secure supervision, given that it’s a school event. This was far from ideal for many of us, especially me—my IB Physics exam was just ten days away! Juggling the hackathon and exam prep was tough, pushing me to really prioritize and stay organized to make sure I was ready for both. It was a lesson in balancing what I love with what I had to get done.

### Hack Day: Excitement and Pressure
When hack day finally came, it was a mix of pure excitement and total chaos. Coordinating 300+ students, managing workshops, and making sure everything went smoothly was no small task. And when it came to judging, it was clear the participants had truly outdone themselves. We had everything from mental health apps to environmental tech solutions—it was inspiring to see their creativity in action. Watching these ideas come to life made every late night of planning worth it.

### Grateful for an Incredible Support Network
YRHacks 2024 couldn’t have happened without the incredible support around us. To our judges who spent hours evaluating projects, our sponsors who funded resources and prizes, and our execs who went above and beyond at every step, I’m so grateful. A special thanks to our teacher supervisors, supportive principals, and everyone at YRDSB who helped guide us, ensuring we had everything needed for success. This was truly a team effort, from start to finish.

### Lessons Learned and What’s Next
Leading YRHacks taught me that leadership isn’t just about making decisions; it’s about creating a shared purpose and helping everyone shine. I’ve grown as a listener, a problem-solver, and someone who values collaboration above all else. Looking back, I’m incredibly proud of what we accomplished and inspired by all the amazing projects students brought to life. 

As we start looking forward to YRHacks 2025, I’m excited to take what we’ve learned to make the next event even bigger and better, building on this year’s success to inspire even more young minds.

Stay tuned—we’re only just getting started!

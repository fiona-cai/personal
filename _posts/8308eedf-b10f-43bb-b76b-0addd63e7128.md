## RBC Summer Tech Labs Internship Experience 🌟

Over the past **two months**, I’ve had the incredible opportunity to be part of the **Summer Tech Labs program** within **RBC’s Technology and Operations branch**. 

### Project Overview

My pod, consisting of **Bryan Peart, Keya Khamar,** and **Lucas Kim**, worked closely with the **HomeX team**. Together, we developed a **full web application** using an **Angular frontend** and a **Spring Boot Java backend** to help improve users' experience when applying for mortgages.

### Acknowledgments

I am truly grateful to all the people who supported this program, including:

- **Melissa Rose**
- **Noelle Rendine**
- **Alexandria W.**
- The entire **Early Talent team**

Special thanks to my pod manager, **Soroush Mosavati**, and tech lead, **Niloy G.**, who were both incredibly supportive, helping me navigate through the learning curves and roadblocks that came my way.

### Reflecting on the Experience

This summer has undoubtedly been one of the **best experiences of my life** so far. From the program team to every individual I had the pleasure of working with, you all have been incredibly knowledgeable and inspirational. Beyond that, you are some of the **funniest** and **kindest people** I have ever met. 💗

> Thank you, RBC, for an unforgettable summer!

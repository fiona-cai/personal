Over the past **two months**, I’ve had the incredible opportunity to be part of the **Summer Tech Labs program** within **RBC’s Technology and Operations branch**. 



### Project Overview

My pod, consisting of **Bryan Peart, Keya Khamar,** and **Lucas Kim**, worked closely with the **HomeX team**. Together, we developed a **full web application** using an **Angular frontend** and a **Spring Boot Java backend** to help improve users' experience when applying for mortgages.

### Acknowledgments

I am truly grateful to all the people who supported this program, including:

- **Melissa Rose**
- **Noelle Rendine**
- **Alexandria W.**
- The entire **Early Talent team**

Special thanks to my pod manager, **Soroush Mosavati**, and tech lead, **Niloy G.**, who were both incredibly supportive, helping me navigate through the learning curves and roadblocks that came my way.

### (Edited) Excerpts from Fiona's Diary
#### Day 1
During lunch, I met with my pod mentor to discuss the task at hand. I found HomeX really interesting, especially since it involves both front-end and back-end work. Thanks to my HL Economics background, I actually understand mortgage concepts (future Fiona writing, I in face did not 💀), which makes this project feel like a dream come true. We then had a lengthy conversation over pizza about AI and its ethical implications, pondering where it might lead us in the future.

The team seems solid—everyone has unique skills and excels in what they do, and our mentor seemed to share this sentiment. I managed to learn the names of about half the people today.

#### Day 2
Today, we focused mainly on installing everything. We finally went downstairs to see where we'd be working on most days. Floor 21 had an interesting desk setup where the desks could move up and down, and the monitors were really adjustable too. I've never downloaded things onto my computer this efficiently before, and Bryan taught me some cool keyboard shortcuts, like how to hide and unhide files. We decided to use Angular for the front end, and the backend will be mostly Java. I'm excited to finally start coding tomorrow!

#### Day 3
Today, we continued setting up our laptops. We focused mainly on learning Spring Boot and Git with IntelliJ. By the end of the day, we got to try running the application, which was like a Java file with HTML code inside, featuring CSS styling and JS scripting—it was super cool! Later, we had two workshops: one on Git and one on Jira. I think both will be very useful in the next two months.

#### Day 4
The day started off with me struggling to use the RBC VPN at home. I tried to fix it myself but ended up calling Melissa and who then referred me to tech support. They were able to fix it on their side really quickly and I made it on time to our meeting with Niloy at 10:30. We walked us through Jira and now we have 4 tickets to do until Wednesday/Thursday. Bryan and I worked on the Spring Boot repo while Keya and Lucas worked on the Angular one. We also had this networking/coffeechat workshop from Melissa and I asked her to add me to the mentorship program - hoping I get paired with a current co-op student!

#### Day 5
Today, we spent the entire day productively coding. We started with two stand-ups at the same time, so we rescheduled the HomeX one to be after our STL one. During the stand-up, we explained to the mentors what we've been doing for the last week and all the tickets we've finished. The rest of the day was spent attempting (and successfully) deploying the repository—now the application contents are visible within the server, thereby publishing it within the company. I was able to shadow Niloy for a bit after that, and he gave me some good career advice and taught us about data structures and what a GraphQL file does. Today involved a lot of learning—from Docker to the pipeline—and I realized I sort of enjoy DevOps tasks now.

### Reflecting on the Experience

This summer has undoubtedly been one of the **best experiences of my life** so far. From the program team to every individual I had the pleasure of working with, you all have been incredibly knowledgeable and inspirational. Beyond that, you are some of the **funniest** and **kindest people** I have ever met. 💗

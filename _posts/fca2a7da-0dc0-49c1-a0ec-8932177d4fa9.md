Participating in the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge with Team Swordfish was an incredible technical journey filled with complex problem-solving, teamwork, and innovation. Here’s a detailed look into our CanSat adventure, from initial planning to the thrilling launch and post-mission analysis.

### Before the Launch: Planning and Preparation

Our journey began at Bayview Secondary School, where our team of six dedicated grade 11 IB students came together, each bringing unique technical skills to the table.

We dedicated over nine months to designing, building, and testing our CanSat. Our commitment involved meticulous planning and a weekly investment of five hours outside school.

#### Designing the CanSat

Our mission aimed to demonstrate Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) by integrating camera footage with inertial navigation data. We employed custom circuit boards featuring:

- An ARM Cortex-M4 STM32L431RCT6 microcontroller for interfacing with sensors.
- A RunCam Thumb Pro camera for navigation.
- Sensors including a BMI088 IMU, LIS3MDL magnetometer, and BMP388 barometer.
- A 2S 7.4V lithium-ion battery with SMPS for efficient power management.

The recovery system utilized a spill-hole parachute, enhancing descent stability and minimizing sway for clearer footage.

#### Outreach and Support

We secured sponsorships with Telesat, NAV Canada, MetroEV, and Faust Law Firm, gaining financial backing and insights from industry experts. Our outreach included hosting events at local schools to inspire younger students in STEM fields and engaging with the community through social media.

### During the Launch: The Big Day

Launch day was the culmination of our rigorous preparations. From a safe distance, we monitored the CanSat’s functionality through our GUI, verifying real-time data transmission via the Reyax RYLR896 radio module. The CanSat successfully transitioned between states—idle, data acquisition, and touchdown—demonstrating the effectiveness of our finite state machine design. This seamless operation validated our embedded software and hardware integration.

### After the Launch: Reflection and Analysis

Post-launch, we retrieved and analyzed data using advanced computer vision and sensor fusion algorithms. The TRN system's accuracy was evaluated against GNSS data, providing insights into the precision of our sensor fusion techniques. We also assessed our outreach efforts, reflecting on our project's impact and identifying areas for improvement. This analysis highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration in complex technical projects.

### Conclusion

Participating in the CanSat challenge was an unforgettable technical experience. It reinforced the value of teamwork, meticulous planning, and the thrill of seeing a project come to life. Our journey transcended technical achievement; it was about growing as engineers and preparing ourselves for future challenges with confidence and expertise.

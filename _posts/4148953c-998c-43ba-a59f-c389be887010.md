I'm currently writing this from my hotel room in China. About a week ago, I committed to my program on OUAC. The week before that was prom, and the week before that I was still writing my IB exams. Crazy how fast time goes.

### Dreams and Reality

If you had asked me four years ago what my dream program was, I'd tell you it was Waterloo CS. If you asked me for my reasoning, I'd probably stutter - in truth, it was just what everyone around me wanted, so I thought that meant I should make it my goal too. (It wasn't that shallow though, because "everyone" represented the people I surrounded myself with - people who had similar goals and passions.)

If you had asked me two to three years ago - after my grandpa (who was like my third parent) passed away and after my mom first got sick - what I wanted to do with my life, I'd tell you that I had no more dreams and felt lost in every aspect. I didn't even know what I wanted to do day-to-day, let alone know what I wanted to do in three years or the rest of my life.

Somewhere in Grade 11, I for whatever reason wanted to go to the US for university. Actually, I know what the reason was: probably the idea that if I didn't apply, then it'd be a waste of doing the IB program. And it worked the other way around too, because I really wanted to quit the IB program because I felt it was holding me back in all the other aspects of my life and was taking up too much of my time. Thus, having the American dream here fixed my problem because it forced me to stay and do well.

And why did I feel the need to do that? I don't know. Pride, maybe? Or maybe fear of what the people around me would think if I quit.

I took the SAT in June of my Grade 11 year with minimal studying because I guess somewhere in my head I knew that going to the US for undergrad wasn't actually what I wanted. I honestly had no idea what life would look like if I wasn't geographically close to my parents and also how much tuition would cost.

That summer I told myself I'd start working on my IB Extended Essay and start writing my CommonApp essays - I didn't do either. Instead, I went to hackathons and worked a summer internship. Reason? I had no passion to do the things I felt that I "should do," and the things that I liked doing felt like a guilty pleasure.

Later, when school started again, I went to Boston twice for competitions and got a MIT tour and walked around Harvard.

This probably reignited my "I want to go to the US" dreams. However, at this point, I decided not to apply early decision because I knew I could get my predicted IB grades up before regular decision. This also let me have time to focus on my Canadian school applications and scholarships.

The first US deadline was for UC schools. I wrote my essays and entire application for that matter on the night of. Since California is three hours behind, I quite literally started at 9 PM and submitted my application at around 2:30 AM. After this, I was like, "Ok, I need to not do this for my other applications."

At this point, my parents started to have conversations with me about how they didn't want me to go to the US. So, I really didn't have the drive to work on my essays anymore. I ended up finishing each application basically the day of, and I only fully applied to Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon. I ended up having an online Princeton interview and... an in-person Harvard interview.

I really shouldn't have thought that a Harvard interview meant anything, but the fact that it was in real life made it so much more real. In the end, I (rightly so, based on my efforts) did not get into a single US university that I applied to and got waitlisted at both UC Berkeley and UCLA.

### Canadian Applications

During all of this, I was also doing my Canadian supplementals. I held myself to a much tighter schedule, where I finished each application at least a week or two before the deadline and took much more care and thought with my writing. The same applied for the big scholarships I applied to, like Loran and Schulich. The former, in which I got through a few rounds, and the latter, in which I got nominated from my school.

It didn't end there, though. I ended up getting the $120K Schulich Leader Scholarship for Software Engineering at Waterloo.

I clearly remember that morning. I opened my email during English class and saw the email. I had to read the email three times to confirm it was actually what I thought it was. I then immediately went to my math teacher's room in the basement to tell her. On my way there, I also saw my CS teacher by coincidence. It was just a very, very happy day.

### The Scholarship Dilemma

For the next three weeks, I was Software Engineering '30 at Waterloo. I told people that. Until I got that email:

> "I’m very happy to let you know that you’ve now been selected by the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo to receive a Schulich Leader Scholarship! We know that you’ve already accepted the SLS offer for Software Engineering. Engineering and Mathematics have separate selection committees for their scholarships. So you now have the option to consider the SLS for Computer Science or Mathematics instead. This SLS offer is for $100,000."

That night I was cramming for my Economics HL IB exam the next morning at 8:30 AM. I read it, felt happy, thought "Yeah but $120k is more than $100k and I can be an engineer," told my parents, and went on with my night.

After getting home that day though, CS vs SE became the most difficult decision of my life for the next seven days. And I took all seven days.

I asked every person I knew who had good advice. I asked myself what I wanted. I thought about what I wanted out of university and what I wanted to do with my education.

The thing was, both programs are really good and similar, at the same university. Realistically my life would be mostly the same. After factoring in SE's larger tuition, the money difference wasn't significant.

- Although I was interested in building, I wasn't sure enough about that passion to pursue it forever.
- Becoming an engineer wasn't really something I wanted - it felt like a title I needed to prove myself to others.
- I needed the extra room from CS: 8-month internships, electives I actually find interesting.

## I am now officially an incoming Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

Younger fi would be very happy to know that.

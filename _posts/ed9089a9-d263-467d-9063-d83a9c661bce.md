I went to Boston again for a Harvard and MIT joint team math competition called HMMT. I was the captain of the Bayview team, and we came back this year with results better than the last few years. We got **20th in Sweepstakes (overall)**, **26th in the team round**, **16th in the guts round**, (and **2nd in the estimathon**)! The journey to HMMT was quite a long one—from picking the team to actually getting there.


### Picking the Team

This process started back in grade 11 when I became president of the math club in May-June. We held our first round of team selections with a problem set and an online proctoring session. Only about 25 people participated, and we selected 2-3 people for the team at that time. This process continued into the summer, and I remember marking selection tests while lying down on a hotel bed in Las Vegas.

After summer training sessions, we held a second team selection test. This time, it was in person, and more than one whole classroom of people participated—around 40 people in total. We carefully marked all 40 papers and analyzed unique skills to finalize our team of six. This was a long and meticulous process, but we were excited to move forward. Finally, we waited for the HMMT lottery.



### The Lottery

Long story short, we won the lottery for both the November and February competitions. We decided to attend the November competition, as we weren’t confident in proofs as a team. We received confirmation on **September 23rd**, leaving us a little over a month to plan the entire trip.



### Planning the Trip

Our math club supervisor was super helpful and essentially handled the entire trip planning process. Since it was an international school trip, we were accompanied by another math teacher and the vice principal. I wasn’t very familiar with them, so our initial meeting felt slightly awkward. The trip cost came down to around **$850 per person**, and with that, we were ready to go.



### Getting There

Most Torontonians are familiar with Toronto Pearson Airport, but it was more convenient for us to leave from downtown Toronto via Billy Bishop Airport. The airport, located on an island, was a new experience for me. The plane was smaller, and the process felt simpler than at Pearson. While waiting to board, I reviewed some chemistry notes.

The flight itself was uneventful, and we took an Uber to our hotel upon landing. Later, we headed to MIT for the opening ceremony. At MIT, we received cool free merch from Citadel and Jane Street, as well as two boxes of “emergency pizza” from Domino’s, which looked (and tasted) a bit suspicious.



### Friday Night

The opening ceremony was just okay—not particularly exciting. However, we noticed that Jane Street was hosting an **estimathon** with free bubble tea as a prize and a poker game afterward. The estimathon was super fun! We teamed up with another group from Ontario to form a 12-person team, and we placed **2nd out of 20 teams**. True to their word, the bubble tea was excellent and far exceeded my expectations.

Half of our team wanted to head back to the hotel, so we split up. The poker room was full, so I joined an old friend for a game of Liar’s Dice. We played for a couple of hours before heading back to the hotel around 9 PM to rest for the competition day.

### Before the Competition

The next morning, our teachers found a nice bakery, and I got a fresh bagel for breakfast. When we arrived at Harvard, we discovered that free breakfast was also provided at the venue, though it didn’t look as appetizing as my bagel. We spent some time in a random room doing last-minute prep, feeling nervous together.



### Individual and Theme Rounds

The individual and theme rounds had the same format: 10 questions, with scores weighted based on the number of correct responses. The theme round this year focused on space. Both rounds were taken in a regular Harvard lecture hall, with each competitor spaced one seat apart. It was a new experience for me, but I managed to score **4 questions correct in both rounds**, which was much better than I expected!



### The Time Between Rounds

I don’t remember much from this time, but I think we grabbed lunch at Shake Shack and walked around the Harvard campus.



### Team and Guts Rounds

For the **team round**, we were in a smaller room with just one other team. We divided the 10 questions among our members to work faster and ended up placing **26th overall**.

The **guts round** was my favorite! It’s an 80-minute event with 36 short-answer questions divided into sets of three. A team runner collects problem sets, and scores are updated in real time. At the five-minute mark, the scores froze, and we were **8th on the leaderboard**. By the end, we placed **16th**.



### Saturday Night

Before the closing ceremony, we wandered around Harvard and played foosball at Shake Shack.

The closing ceremony was exciting—one of my teammates placed **2nd individually overall** and received other awards. It was amazing to cheer for him and see his prizes. To celebrate, we went to a nice restaurant before heading back to the hotel to prepare for our 6 AM flight.



### Coming Back

The trip home was uneventful, but I felt incredibly grateful for the opportunity to visit Boston twice in such a short span for different math competitions. This experience changed my perspective on math and further ignited my passion for it. After spending so much time recently focused on computer science and hackathons, this was like a breath of fresh air. I hope to continue pursuing math in university and beyond.

  I've been going to many hackathons in the last bit and after each one I'd have
  a new project. Some of them were cooler than others and that's ok.

I've been going to many hackathons in the last bit and after each one I'd have a new project. Some of them were cooler than others and that's ok.

I think something I've learned in the last bit is that it's ok to have fun at hackathons instead of coding. I used to feel so guilty doing this but now I understand that there's nothing wrong with it.

I went to 2 hackathons back to back last month. We made a whole 911 emergency services system with websockets and connected it to phone calls. The next week - total 360 - I made a chemistry version of Brawl Stars with my friends.

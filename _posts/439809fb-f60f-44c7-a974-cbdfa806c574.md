This weekend, my team (**Ibrahim Khawar**, **Lucas Kim**, and **Prerana Manoj**) built **TrackBack**, a mindful companion that tracks your belongings wherever you go! üçÉ 

### Project Overview

**TrackBack** streams footage from a wearable camera to **S3**, where a background service processes and analyzes it using a **YOLOv8** model to detect key objects. This data is accessible to a **Voiceflow** agent, allowing users to ask where they last saw a missing item. 

> This is a game changer for individuals with dementia, helping them ‚Äúremember‚Äù the location of important belongings like medication.

### Learning and Networking

I learned so much from speakers like:
- **Sulman Choudhry**
- **Lucy Guo**
- **Edward Kim**

I also feel incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to pitch my ideas to **Braden Ream** and **Kayla Kavanaugh**, who gave us insightful feedback on our product and use of the Voiceflow platform.

### Highlights of the Hackathon

This hackathon had the:
- **Best food**
- **Workshops**
- **Swag**

I‚Äôll definitely take inspiration from the organizers when planning **YRHacks**, the largest high school hackathon in Canada this year!

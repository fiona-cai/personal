I was **honored** to be invited to the **Math Prize for Girls (MP4G)** after my success in the **AMC** in November and the **AIME** in February. 

The MP4G is a competition that recognizes the **top 250 female math students**, providing an opportunity for talented young women to showcase their skills and connect with peers who share their passion for mathematics.

### Gratitude to My Parents

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my parents for driving me to the competition, supporting my journey in math, and encouraging me to pursue my interests.


### Attending MP4G was an incredible experience where I had the chance to:
- Engage with inspiring women in math
- Participate in challenging problems
- Gain insights from mentors who truly understand the journey of a female mathematician

### I was also able to:
- Explore the **MIT campus**
- Sleep in an **MIT dorm**
- Meet many students there - super cool!

> I honestly didn't have high expectations for myself in this competition, but I ended up being able to solve a few questions, which made me really happy!

This solution featured dynamic payment calculations and was integrated with a new mortgage renewal tool, providing a seamless one-click experience for clients to choose better rates and payment options.\n\nUtilized Angular and an in-house RBC design system (RIG) for the responsive frontend, while the backend was powered by Java and Spring Boot to handle complex calculations and business logic. The application was deployed to the UAT environment using OpenShift 4 and Jenkins, following CI/CD best practices for smooth releases.\n\nThe project earned recognition from stakeholders for its technical execution and presentation.","imageSrc":"/images/1724537604160.jpeg","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fiona--cai_internship-rbc-activity-7233239154753429505-lDoe?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop","headline":"üíª Internship at RBC"},{"title":"Team Swordfish","description":"In the CanSat Design Challenge held in Lethbridge, Alberta, our team designed a satellite the size of a pop can, which was launched by high-powered amateur rockets (or carried by a drone) to a height of up to one kilometer. During its descent, our CanSat conducted experiments using Terrain Relative Navigation to precisely track its position and attitude, utilizing only an onboard camera and an inertial navigation system. This technology is essential in environments where GPS is unavailable, such as the Moon. The embedded software uses C/C++ and a finite state machine to manage the CanSat's operational states (Idle, Data Acquisition, Touchdown). Our innovative approach earned us the Best Technical and Best Scientific Mission awards at the competition. Following our success, we were invited to appear on the show \"Ask an Astronomer.\"","imageSrc":"/images/Screen Shot 2024-08-11 at 9.24.57 PM.png","url":"https://www.instagram.com/team__swordfish/","headline":"Canadian CanSat üöÄ Design Challenge"},{"title":"Signematic","headline":"2nd Place üèÜ at JAMHacks 8","description":"JAMHacks is one of Canada's largest high school hackathons based out of the University of Waterloo with 150+ high school hackers.
